  Welcome! My name is Peter and I spend my professional life building automated test systems.  I use LabVIEW and TestStand religiously but have been known to dabble in Python, web development and data science.

The primary purpose of this website is to document the trials and tribulations of using evolving technology. Hopefully both you and I get something out of it!  It's made by [@PeteDunc](https://twitter.com/PeteDunc).

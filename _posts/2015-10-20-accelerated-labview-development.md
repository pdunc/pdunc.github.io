title: Accelerated LabVIEW Development

<div class="message">
  The presentation was generated using LabVIEW 2015. Not all features are available in previous versions, and are subject to change!

  Otherwise, enjoy!

I was lucky enough to help host the inaugural Scottish LabVIEW & TestStand User Group on 20th October 2015.  We had 25 people from across the UK attending and I had the honour of being first to present.

This presentation is an amalgamation of years of tinkering in LabVIEW - the goal being that everyone can pick up at least a *minimum* of one feature which they haven't seen before.

It was fun to collate and fun to deliver, looking forward to the next one!
